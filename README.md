# AirbnbNYC

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data from New York City (2023) to explore the factors influencing listing prices and identify listings that offer the best value. Key techniques used include regression analysis to determine price drivers and clustering to compare high-price vs low-price listings. The dataset includes information such as neighborhood, room type, price, reviews, and availability. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights into pricing strategies for hosts and help identify well-priced, high-quality listings.
